# Summary:
People have been struggling with remembering when to water their plants and how much water should be used. Also, it is hard to remember when to apply fertilizer at an appropriate time. This app will help you with planting. It will remind you when it is time to water your plants and you can even set different clocks for multiple plants. This app will also automatically adjust the amount of water and frequency to water based on the weather conditions and the plantsâ€™ preferences.
# Users:
People who want to be successful at planting
# MVP description:
A minimal viable product would be an interface that the user can input the frequency for watering for a single plant and the app reminds the user when to water based on the input frequency. This is a MVP because the first goal of this project is to remind people to water their plants in order to be better at planting.
